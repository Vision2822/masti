## **Lab Sessions - Master Study Notes**

### **Lab 3: Classes and the `__init__` Method (Object-Oriented Programming)**

This lab introduces the fundamental concept of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. The goal of OOP is to model real-world things (like a car, a teacher, a student) by bundling data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into objects.

#### **1. Core Concepts: Classes and Objects**

- **Class:** A **blueprint** or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.
  - **Analogy:** The architectural blueprint for a house. It defines that the house will have rooms, doors, and windows, but it's not the house itself.
- **Object (or Instance):** A specific **instance** created from a class. It has its own unique data (attributes) based on the blueprint.
  - **Analogy:** An actual house built from the blueprint. There can be many houses built from the same blueprint, but each is a separate entity.

#### **2. The `__init__()` Method: The Constructor**

The `__init__()` method is one of Python's special "dunder" (double underscore) methods. It is the **constructor** for a class.

- **Purpose:** To **initialize** the state of a new object when it is created. Its job is to set up the initial values for the object's attributes.
- **Automatic Call:** You **never call `__init__()` directly**. It is called automatically by Python the moment you create a new instance of the class.
- **The `self` Parameter:**
  - `self` is the **most important parameter** in `__init__()` and all other _instance methods_.
  - It **must be the first parameter** of any instance method.
  - It represents the **instance of the object itself**. It's how the object gets a reference to its own memory space.
  - You use `self` to create and access the object's attributes (e.g., `self.model`, `self.age`).
  - **Mastery Tip:** When you call a class to create an object like `car1 = Car("Tesla", 2022)`, Python internally translates this to `Car.__init__(car1, "Tesla", 2022)`. It automatically passes the newly created object (`car1`) as the `self` argument.

#### **3. Instance Attributes**

- **Definition:** Variables that belong to a specific instance of a class. Each object has its own separate set of instance attributes.
- **Creation:** They are created inside the `__init__` method by assigning a value to `self.attribute_name`.

```python
class Car:
  # The __init__ method (constructor)
  def __init__(self, model, year):
    # 'self' refers to the specific object being created (e.g., car1)
    # The next two lines create instance attributes for that object
    self.model = model
    self.year = year

# Creating an object (instance) of the Car class.
# This automatically calls __init__
car1 = Car("Tesla", 2022)
# Now, car1 has its own attributes: car1.model is "Tesla" and car1.year is 2022
```

#### **4. Problem Analysis from MCQs**

Let's break down the questions from your lab quiz.

**Question 1 & 3: Basic Object Creation and Attribute Access**

```python
# Question 1 Code
class Car:
  def __init__(self, model, year):
    self.model = model
    self.year = year
car1 = Car("Tesla", 2022)
car2 = Car("Toyota", 2019)
print(car1.model, car1.year)  # Access attributes of the first object
print(car2.model, car2.year)  # Access attributes of the second object

# Question 3 Code
class Teacher:
  def __init__(self, id, age):
    self.id = id
    self.age = age
    print(self.age) # This runs during object creation
tear = Teacher("John", 20)  # 1. Object created. __init__ runs. Prints 20.
tear.age = 30              # 2. The 'age' attribute of the 'tear' object is updated.
print(tear.age)            # 3. The new value is printed.
```

- **Explanation:**
  1.  When `Car("Tesla", 2022)` is called, a `Car` object is created. The `__init__` method runs, setting `self.model` to "Tesla" and `self.year` to 2022 for that specific object.
  2.  `car1` and `car2` are two completely separate objects in memory, each with its own `model` and `year`.
  3.  In the `Teacher` example, the first `print` happens _inside the constructor_, so it prints the initial value (20). The attribute is then modified _after_ creation, so the second `print` shows the new value (30).
- **Output for Question 1:** `Tesla 2022` followed by `Toyota 2019` on the next line.
- **Output for Question 3:** `20` followed by `30` on the next line.

**Question 2: Understanding `self`**

- **The incorrect statement is:** "The `self` parameter is optional in the `__init__` method."
- **Why it's wrong:** `self` is **mandatory** as the first parameter for `__init__` and any other method that needs to access or modify the object's own attributes. Without it, the method wouldn't know which object's data to work with.

**Question 4: Pass-by-Assignment and Immutability**

```python
class Test:
  def __init__(self):
    self.variable = 'Old'      # 1. Instance attribute is set to 'Old'
    self.change(self.variable) # 2. The *value* 'Old' is passed to the change method

  def change(self, var):
    # 3. 'var' is a NEW, LOCAL variable inside this method. It gets the value 'Old'.
    var = 'New'                # 4. The LOCAL variable 'var' is now made to point to 'New'.
                               #    This does NOT affect the original self.variable.
obj = Test()                   # 5. Create the object, running __init__
print(obj.variable)            # 6. Print the original instance attribute.
```

- **Explanation (Crucial Concept):** Python's parameter passing is "pass-by-assignment." When you pass `self.variable` to the `change` method, you are passing the **string object `'Old'`**. Inside the method, `var = 'New'` does **not** change the original string. Strings are **immutable**. Instead, it makes the local variable `var` refer to a brand-new string object, `'New'`. The instance attribute `obj.variable` remains untouched, still pointing to `'Old'`.
- **Output:** `'Old'`

**Question 5 & 6: Method Calls and Constructor Theory**

```python
# Question 5 Code
class MyClass:
  def __init__(self, value):
    self.value = value
  def manipulate(self, value):
    return value * 2
  def calculate(self):
    # This method calls another method on the same object using self
    return self.manipulate(self.value)

obj = MyClass(5)
print(obj.calculate())
```

- **Explanation:**
  1.  `obj` is created with `self.value` set to `5`.
  2.  `obj.calculate()` is called.
  3.  Inside `calculate`, `self.manipulate(self.value)` is called. This is `obj.manipulate(5)`.
  4.  `manipulate` receives `5`, calculates `5 * 2`, and returns `10`.
  5.  `calculate` receives the `10` and returns it.
  6.  The `print` function displays the final result.
- **Output:** `10`
- **Question 6 (Theory):** The correct statement is, "Constructors are used to initialize the state of an object." This is the primary purpose of `__init__`.

### **Lab 6: The `zip()` Function**

The `zip()` function is a powerful built-in tool for combining multiple iterables (like lists or tuples) in parallel.

#### **1. What `zip()` Does**

- It takes one or more iterables as arguments.
- It returns an **iterator** of tuples.
- The first tuple contains the first element from each iterable, the second tuple contains the second element from each, and so on.

#### **2. The Most Important Rule: Handling Different Lengths**

This is the key concept tested in your MCQs.

- `zip()` **stops as soon as the shortest input iterable is exhausted.** It does **not** raise an error or pad the shorter lists with `None`. The extra elements in the longer iterables are simply ignored.

#### **3. Problem Analysis from MCQs**

**Question 1: Zipping Lists of Equal Length**

```python
list1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
# zip will produce an iterator that yields: ('a', 1), then ('b', 2), then ('c', 3)
result = tuple(zip(list1, list2)) # Convert the iterator into a tuple
print(result)
```

- **Explanation:** `zip` pairs corresponding elements. `tuple()` then consumes the entire iterator to create a tuple of these pairs.
- **Output:** `(('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3))`

**Question 2 & 3: Zipping Lists of Different Lengths**

```python
# Question 2 Code
list1 = [10, 20, 30]                     # Length is 3
list2 = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date'] # Length is 4

# zip will pair (10, 'apple'), (20, 'banana'), (30, 'cherry').
# It stops here because list1, the SHORTEST iterable, has run out of items.
# The item 'date' from list2 is ignored.
result = list(zip(list1, list2))
print(result)
```

- **Explanation:** The `zip` operation stops after the third element because `list1` has only three elements. The result is an iterator that produces three tuples. `list()` converts this into a list of those three tuples.
- **Output for Question 2:** `[(10, 'apple'), (20, 'banana'), (30, 'cherry')]`
- **For Question 3 (Theory):** This directly tests the rule. The correct answer is, "The resulting iterator's length is determined by the shortest input iterable."

---

### **Final Summary & Tips for the Exam**

- **`__init__` is the Constructor:** It runs automatically to set up an object's initial attributes.
- **`self` is Mandatory:** It's the first parameter of instance methods and refers to the object itself.
- **Immutable vs. Mutable:** Understand that reassigning an immutable type (like a string or number) inside a function creates a _new_ local variable and does **not** change the original object's attribute.
- **`zip()` Stops Early:** The length of a zipped result is always the length of the _shortest_ iterable you pass to it.
