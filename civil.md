### 1. Explain the terms
*   **a. Space:** This is the geometric region that bodies occupy. Positions in space are described using linear and angular measurements relative to a coordinate system. For 2D problems, two coordinates are needed, while 3D problems require three.
*   **b. Time:** This is the measure of the succession of events. While it's a fundamental quantity in dynamics, it is not directly involved in statics problems.
*   **c. Mass:** This is the measure of a body's inertia, which is its resistance to a change in velocity. It can also be considered the amount of matter in a body. Mass is a factor in the gravitational attraction between bodies.
*   **d. Force:** This is the action of one body on another. A force has a tendency to move a body in the direction of its action. Its action is defined by its magnitude, direction, and point of application.
*   **e. Particle:** This is a body with negligible dimensions. When a body's dimensions are irrelevant to describing its position or the forces acting on it, it can be treated as a particle, or a mass concentrated at a single point.
*   **f. Rigid body:** A body is considered rigid when the change in distance between any two of its points is negligible for the problem being analyzed. Statics primarily deals with calculating external forces acting on rigid bodies in equilibrium.

### 2. Explain the difference between Scalars and Vectors.
Scalar quantities are those that are described by a magnitude only. Examples include time, volume, mass, and energy.

Vector quantities possess both magnitude and direction, and they must conform to the parallelogram law of addition. Examples of vector quantities are force, displacement, velocity, and moment.

### 3. Explain the terms a. Fixed Vector b. Sliding Vector c. Free Vector.
*   **a. Free Vector:** A free vector is one whose action is not limited to a unique line in space. For instance, the displacement of a body moving without rotation can be represented by a free vector, as it describes the movement of every point in the body equally.
*   **b. Sliding Vector:** A sliding vector has a unique line of action but not a unique point of application. An external force on a rigid body is a sliding vector because it can be applied at any point along its line of action without changing its overall effect on the body.
*   **c. Fixed Vector:** A fixed vector is one for which a unique point of application is specified. The action of a force on a deformable (non-rigid) body must be treated as a fixed vector, as the point of application affects the resulting deformations.

### 4. Explain the terms (with sketches)
*   **a. Collinear Forces:** These are forces that lie along the same straight line. A sketch can be seen in Figure 3/3, item 1, on page 137.
*   **b. Coplanar Parallel Forces:** These are forces that lie in the same plane and have parallel lines of action. A sketch can be seen in Figure 2/4 on page 41 and Figure 3/3, item 3, on page 137.
*   **c. Coplanar Concurrent Forces:** These are forces whose lines of action lie in the same plane and intersect at a common point. This is illustrated in Figure 2/3a on page 40 and Figure 3/3, item 2, on page 137.
*   **d. Coplanar Non-Concurrent Forces:** This is a general system where all forces act in the same plane but do not intersect at a single point and are not all parallel. This is shown in Figure 2/13a on page 73 and Figure 3/3, item 4, on page 137.
*   **e. Non-Coplanar Parallel Forces:** These are forces with parallel lines of action that do not all lie in the same plane. A sketch can be seen in Figure 3/9, item 3, on page 161.
*   **f. Non-Coplanar Concurrent Forces:** These are forces that do not lie in the same plane but whose lines of action pass through a single common point. This is shown in Figure 3/9, item 1, on page 161.
*   **g. Non-Coplanar Non-Concurrent Forces:** This is a general system of forces in space that are not parallel and do not intersect at a single point. This is depicted in Figure 2/28a on page 104 and Figure 3/9, item 4, on page 161.

### 5. What are (Explain with sketches)
*   **a. Rectangular Components of a force:** These are the components of a force that are mutually perpendicular. The most common resolution of a force is into its rectangular components along the axes of a coordinate system. This is illustrated in Figure 2/5 on page 41.
*   **b. Components of a force:** Any two or more vectors (forces) that sum to equal a certain vector (force) are called the components of that vector. Figure 1/4a on page 21 shows a force V being resolved into two non-rectangular components, V₁ and V₂.
*   **c. Projections of a force:** The perpendicular projection of a force onto an axis is not necessarily the same as its component along that axis, unless the axes are perpendicular. The text on page 41 clarifies this distinction, and it is illustrated in Figure 2/3e on page 40.

### 6. Explain the Transmissibility of a force with a neat sketch.
The principle of transmissibility states that a force acting on a rigid body may be applied at any point on its given line of action without altering the resultant external effects of the force. Therefore, when dealing with the external effects on a rigid body, a force can be treated as a sliding vector. This principle is explained and illustrated with a sketch in Figure 2/2 on page 39.

### 7. Define Force and state its characteristics.
A force is the action of one body on another. The characteristics that define a force are:
*   **Magnitude**
*   **Direction**
*   **Point of application**

### 8. Explain the term Moment of a force with neat sketch.
The moment of a force is the measure of its tendency to cause a body to rotate about an axis. This rotational tendency is also known as torque. The magnitude of the moment (M) is the product of the force's magnitude (F) and the perpendicular distance (d) from the axis to the line of action of the force, so M = Fd. The direction of the moment is identified using the right-hand rule. This concept is explained with sketches in Figure 2/8 on page 54.

### 9. State and prove the Varignon’s theorem.
**Statement:** Varignon’s theorem states that the moment of a force about any point is equal to the sum of the moments of its components about the same point.

**Proof:** As shown on page 56, consider a force R with components P and Q. The moment of R about a point O is given by the cross product M₀ = **r** x **R**. Since **R** = **P** + **Q**, we can write **r** x **R** = **r** x (**P** + **Q**). Using the distributive law for cross products, this becomes **r** x **P** + **r** x **Q**. This proves that the moment of the resultant force **R** is equal to the sum of the moments of its components **P** and **Q**. This is illustrated in Figure 2/9 on page 56.

### 10. What is a Couple?
A couple is the moment produced by two equal, opposite, and noncollinear forces.

### 11. Define the term Couple and state its characteristics.
A couple is defined as two parallel forces that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
Its characteristics are:
*   The magnitude of a couple is the product of the magnitude of one of the forces and the perpendicular distance between their lines of action (M = Fd).
*   The moment of a couple is the same about all points, meaning its rotational effect is independent of the moment center.
*   A couple produces only a tendency of rotation (a "pure moment") and no translation, as the net force is zero.
*   A couple is a free vector, meaning it can be moved anywhere on the body without changing its external effect.

### 12. Explain the term Force-Couple System with the help of neat sketch.
A force-couple system is the combination of a force and a couple that is statically equivalent to a single force acting at a different point. Replacing a given force with an equal parallel force at another point requires adding a couple to compensate for the change in the moment of the force. This process is explained with a clear sketch in Figure 2/12 on page 66.

### 13. State and prove the Principle of Moments.
**Statement:** The principle of moments is an extension of Varignon's theorem to a system of nonconcurrent forces. It states that the moment of the resultant of a force system about any point is equal to the sum of the moments of the individual forces of the system about the same point.

**Proof:** The principle is demonstrated through the algebraic method for finding resultants on pages 73 and 74. A system of forces (F₁, F₂, F₃...) is reduced to a single resultant force **R** and a single resultant couple **M**₀ at an arbitrary point O. The resultant couple **M**₀ is the sum of all moments from the original forces about point O. To find the final line of action of a single resultant force **R** (if one exists), it must be located at a distance *d* from O such that its moment about O is equal to **M**₀. Thus, Rd = M₀ = Σ(Fd), proving the principle. This process is illustrated in Figure 2/14 on page 74.

### 14. Define the term Equilibrium.
Equilibrium is the condition in which the resultant of all forces and moments acting on a body is zero. This means the body is in a state of balance, with no tendency to change its translational or rotational motion. The two vector equations for equilibrium are:
*   **ΣF = 0** (The vector sum of all forces is zero)
*   **ΣM = 0** (The vector sum of all moments about any point is zero)

### 15. State and explain the conditions of equilibrium required for a system of coplanar, concurrent forces.
For a system of forces that are both coplanar (acting in the same plane, e.g., the x-y plane) and concurrent (lines of action intersecting at a single point), the conditions for equilibrium are:
*   **ΣFₓ = 0** (The algebraic sum of the force components in the x-direction is zero)
*   **ΣFᵧ = 0** (The algebraic sum of the force components in the y-direction is zero)

The moment equation (ΣM = 0) is automatically satisfied because, since all forces pass through a single point, the moment of the forces about that point is necessarily zero. This is described as "Category 2" equilibrium in Figure 3/3 on page 137.

### 16. State and explain the conditions of equilibrium required for a system of coplanar, non-concurrent forces.
For a general system of forces that are coplanar but not concurrent (their lines of action do not intersect at a single point), all three conditions for two-dimensional equilibrium must be satisfied:
*   **ΣFₓ = 0** (The algebraic sum of force components in the x-direction is zero)
*   **ΣFᵧ = 0** (The algebraic sum of force components in the y-direction is zero)
*   **ΣMₒ = 0** (The algebraic sum of the moments of all forces about any point O in the plane is zero)

These three equations are necessary and sufficient for complete equilibrium in two dimensions. This is described as "Category 4" equilibrium in Figure 3/3 on page 137.

### 17. Explain the difference between statically determinacy and statically indeterminacy of a structure.
*   **Statically Determinate:** A structure is statically determinate if it is supported by the minimum number of constraints required to ensure a stable equilibrium configuration. For such structures, the equilibrium equations are sufficient to determine all unknown external support forces.
*   **Statically Indeterminate:** A structure is statically indeterminate if it has more external supports or constraints than are necessary to maintain its equilibrium. These extra supports are called redundant. For such structures, the number of unknown support forces is greater than the number of available independent equilibrium equations, and therefore, the reactions cannot be determined using statics alone.

### 18. What is meant by Free Body Diagram and why are they important?
A **Free Body Diagram (FBD)** is a diagrammatic representation of a body or system of bodies that has been conceptually isolated from all of its surroundings. The diagram shows all external forces and couples acting *on* the body, including applied loads, support reactions, and body forces (like weight).

Free Body Diagrams are described in the textbook as "the most important single step in the solution of problems in mechanics." Their importance lies in the fact that they provide a clear and unambiguous picture of all the forces that govern the equilibrium of the body. By completely isolating the body, an FBD allows for a systematic and reliable application of the equilibrium equations to solve for unknown forces.

### 19. What do you understand by the terms “Roller Support”, “Hinge support” and “Fixed Support”.
These terms describe types of structural supports, and their actions are modeled as follows (as shown in Figure 3/1 on pages 126-127):
*   **Roller Support:** This support (including rockers and ball supports) provides a reaction force that is compressive and normal (perpendicular) to the supporting surface. It cannot resist force parallel to the surface or any moment. This is shown in item 4 in Figure 3/1.
*   **Hinge Support (or Pin Support):** A freely hinged pin connection can support a force in any direction in the plane. This reaction force is usually represented by its two rectangular components (e.g., Rₓ and Rᵧ). It cannot support a moment, as it allows free rotation about the pin. This is shown in item 6 in Figure 3/1.
*   **Fixed Support:** A fixed (or built-in) support is capable of resisting an axial force, a transverse (shear) force, and a couple (bending moment). It prevents all motion, both translation and rotation, at the support. This is shown in item 7 in Figure 3/1.

### 20. Explain the terms internal redundancy and external redundancy as applied to trusses.
*   **External Redundancy:** A truss is externally redundant (or statically indeterminate externally) if it has more external support reactions than are necessary to maintain its equilibrium. For a plane truss, more than three support reactions will typically result in external redundancy.
*   **Internal Redundancy:** A truss is internally redundant (or statically indeterminate internally) if it has more internal members than are required to prevent it from collapsing. These extra members are called redundant members.

### 21. What do you understand by m+3 = 2j in case of a truss? What are the implications if this equation is not satisfied?
For a plane truss, the equation **m + 3 = 2j** relates the number of members (*m*) and the number of joints (*j*). It is a necessary condition for a truss to be statically determinate internally. The "2j" represents the total number of independent equilibrium equations (two for each joint), and "m + 3" represents the total number of unknowns (one force for each member, plus three potential support reactions).

The implications if the equation is not satisfied are:
*   **If m + 3 > 2j:** There are more members than are necessary for stability. The truss is **statically indeterminate internally** because it has redundant members.
*   **If m + 3 < 2j:** There is a deficiency of members. The truss is **unstable** and will collapse under a general load.

### 22. With a neat diagram explain symmetry in case of a truss.
Symmetry in a truss refers to a situation where the truss has a symmetrical geometry and is subjected to a symmetrical loading pattern about a central axis. For example, the truss in Problem 4/10 on page 179 is symmetrical.

In a symmetrical truss under symmetrical loading:
*   The reactions at the supports will be equal.
*   The forces in corresponding members on opposite sides of the axis of symmetry will be equal.
This symmetry can be used to simplify the analysis, as determining the force in one member automatically gives the force in its corresponding member on the other side.

### 23. What are the different methods of finding the forces in the members of a truss.
The textbook describes two primary methods for the force analysis of simple trusses:
1.  **Method of Joints (Article 4/3):** This method involves isolating each joint of the truss and applying the two equations of force equilibrium (ΣFₓ = 0 and ΣFᵧ = 0) to the concurrent forces acting on the joint. The analysis proceeds from joint to joint until all member forces are found.
2.  **Method of Sections (Article 4/4):** This method involves passing an imaginary "cut" or section through the truss to divide it into two parts. The entire section is then treated as a single free body, and the three equations of equilibrium (ΣFₓ = 0, ΣFᵧ = 0, and ΣM = 0) are applied to solve for the forces in the cut members. This method is particularly efficient for finding the force in a specific member without having to analyze the entire truss.
